# FIZ BUZZ

The goal of this problem is to write a function which iterates from numbers 1 to 100.  
If the number is divisible by 3, print FIZZ.  
If the number is divisible by 5, print BUZZ.
If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print FIZZBUZZ.  
Otherwise, print the number.

An example from 1 to 15:  
1  
2  
FIZZ  
4  
BUZZ  
FIZZ  
7  
8  
FIZZ  
BUZZ  
11  
FIZZ  
13  
14  
FIZZBUZZ


def fizzbuzz()
  for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++){
    if (i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0) print "FIZZBUZZ";
    else if (i % 3 == 0) print "FIZZ";
    else if (i % 5 == 0) print "BUZZ";
    else print i;
  }
