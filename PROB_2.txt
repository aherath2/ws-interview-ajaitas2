# Number Addition
Given two large numbers stored as strings, add them together. Assume the numbers are so large that they cannot be stored as an int, long, or any other data type.  
Example:  
String result = add("12345", "4512");  
\# result = 16857  

When you finish implementation, what is the runtime order?

def add(string1, string2)
  int carry = 0
  for (int i = 1; i <= string1.length; i++){
    for (int j = 1; j <= string2.length; j++){
      
    }
  }
